Monitoring resource utilization is crucial for maintaining the health, performance, and stability of a tech stack. 
A comprehensive monitoring system should cover various aspects such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, application performance metrics, and more.
Here's some ideas to monitor the resource utilization of a Tech Stack:
1. Metrics Collection Agents: 
- Install monitoring agents on each server or node in the tech stack.
- Agents collect system-level metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic.
- Examples: Prometheus Node Exporter

2. Application Monitoring:
- Instrument applications to capture application-specific metrics.
- Monitor metrics like response times, error rates, database query performance,...
- Integration with application frameworks and libraries for detailed insights.
- Examples: Prometheus with custom exporters

3. Log Aggregation:
- Collect and aggregate logs from various services and applications.
- Centralize logs for easier troubleshooting and analysis.
- Allows correlation of logs with metrics for deeper insights.
- Examples: Elasticsearch, Logstash

4. Visualization and Dashboarding:
- Tools to create visual representations of collected metrics.
- Create dashboards for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
- Customizable dashboards for different teams and use cases.
- Examples: Grafana, Kibana.

5. Alerting and Notification:
- Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Receive notifications via email when thresholds are exceeded.
- Proactive alerting to address issues before they impact users.
- Examples: Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana alerts.
