When receiving an alert that a service is down or slow, it's crucial to act quickly to investigate and resolve the issue.
1. My steps to resolve the problem:
- Upon receiving the alert, acknowledge it to indicate that it's being looked into.
- Check Monitoring Dashboard:
    + Log into the monitoring dashboard (e.g. Grafana) to get an overview of the service's metrics.
    + Look for any anomalies or spikes in CPU usage, memory usage, response times,...
- Check Service Status: 
    + Connect to the server hosting the service (SSH or remote desktop).
    + Verify the status of the service using system commands or service-specific commands: systemctl status "service name"
    + Ensure the service is running and active.
- Review Logs:
    + Check service logs for errors or warnings that might indicate the issue.
    + Look for any specific error messages or stack traces.
- Check Dependencies:
    + Some services rely on external dependencies (e.g. database, APIs)
    + Verify the connectivity and status of these dependencies.
    + Check if there are any issues with database connections, API endpoints,...
- Restart the Service:
    + If the service is not responding or is stuck, attempt to restart it.
    + Use the appropriate command to restart the service: sudo systemctl restart "service name"
- Monitor and Verify Recovery:
    + After restarting, monitor the service to ensure it comes back online and is functioning correctly.
    + Check the monitoring dashboard for updated metrics and confirm the service's stability.
- Investigate Root Cause:
    + If the issue persists or if it's a recurring problem, perform a deeper investigation into the root cause.
    + Analyze logs, metrics, and any recent changes or deployments.
    + Use debugging tools or commands specific to the service to gather more information.
- Implement Fixes:
    + Based on the root cause analysis, implement necessary fixes.
    + This could involve applying patches, adjusting configurations, optimizing code,...
    + Ensure proper testing in a staging environment before applying changes in production.
- Document and Communicate:
    + Document the steps taken, including the issue, resolution, and preventive measures.
    + Share the incident report with the team for knowledge sharing and future reference.

2. My steps to prevent the problem:
- Automated Monitoring and Alerts:
    + Set up proactive monitoring with alerting for critical metrics (CPU, memory, response time thresholds).
    + Configure alerts to notify immediately when thresholds are breached.
    + Utilize monitoring tools like Prometheus, Nagios, or Datadog for this purpose.
- Regular Health Checks and Maintenance:
    + Schedule regular health checks for services and dependencies.
    + Perform routine maintenance tasks such as cleaning up logs, optimizing databases,...
- Load Testing and Capacity Planning:
    + Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks.
    + Plan for capacity upgrades or scaling based on load testing results.
- Configuration Management:
    + Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) to ensure consistent and reproducible configurations.
    + Version control configurations and changes for easy rollback and review.
-  Backup and Disaster Recovery:
    + Implement regular backups of critical data and configurations.
    + Have a well-defined disaster recovery plan in place in case of catastrophic failures.
- Continuous Improvement:
    + Conduct post-incident reviews to analyze incidents and identify areas for improvement.
    + Implement lessons learned from incidents to prevent similar issues in the future.
